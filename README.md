# [IdeaBox](https://bpeterson2579.github.io/Idea-Box/)
IdeaBox is an application that allows users to input ideas and save the ideas in a card format.  Once an idea card is displayed, users have the option to favorite or delete a particular card.  A comment feature is also included for each card in case a user chooses to add a comment related to an idea.

## How to Use the App:

- Go to [IdeaBox.](https://bpeterson2579.github.io/Idea-Box/)

- To generate an idea card, users are required to input a title and body in the provided input fields.  Once the title and body are saved, an idea card will populate and display the user inputs.

- Users have the option to favorite or delete the saved idea cards by clicking the star icon and delete icon on each respective card.  Users can also click the comment icon to add a comment.

- The Show Starred Ideas button on the left side of the screen can be selected by users if they would like to filter the saved idea cards down to those cards that are favorited only.

- Users also have the ability to search the saved idea cards for a particular idea.

## Team Wins:
- Able to implement localStorage successfully and have it update every time a change was made to the idea objects
- Getting the favoriting function to toggle was extremely difficult
- We matched the provided comp fairly closely and added some touches to improve the user experience

## Team Challenges:
- We could not get the commenting to work properly.
- Toggling the favorited status took up way more time than any of us expected
- We have had our fair share of git workflow issues along the way
